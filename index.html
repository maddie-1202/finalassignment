<p>I am Madison Austin. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Digital Innovations with an emphasis in Graphic Communications. Iâ€™ve been an art enthusiast since I was a little girl, and have been chasing my art dreams for most of my twenties. After taking a year away from Graphic Design to pursue a different degree, I realized my passion truly lied in art. Even though my degree leans toward the digital side of the works, hands-on techniques are what I enjoy the most. My favorite pastime is painting and pretty much making anything with my hands. My goal is to eventually work freelance so that I can have flexible hours that accommodate my time with my two daughters. I hope one day I can be an inspiration to other aspiring artists the way I have been inspired growing up. </p>
